This script interfaces between arbitrary scripts (which connect via a TCP socket) and an MML system, such as that of the Huawei INs (with which it has been tested).

The system can then enforce whitelisting, and logging and other arbitrary rules.
It has been tested with hundreds of connections per second.

It takes JSON conf files, a sample of which is in `lib/conf.js`.
